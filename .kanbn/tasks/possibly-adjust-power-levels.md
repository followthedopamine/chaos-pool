# Possibly adjust power levels

I think the acceleration gauge should be shorter/have less range on it. I only ever went a bit past 1/4 of it when I was getting better/more used to the game. Using halfway or more in the gauge for acceleration and the balls you aim and hit will just go speeding across the table (which there isn't really much point in). Since I was stuck on level 3 I didn't experiment much with the ablities so perhaps having more acceleration would be useful for them (the blue one, perhaps?)
